Also... their wifi is on a chalkboard on the counter wink wink",

Their floor-to-ceiling windows make you feel like you're in an aquarium in the best way possible, there's a small upstairs seating area I prefer sectioned off by a spiral staircase, and it's teeming with plants! You can't really go wrong with whatever you order but I'm always partial to their berry rose tea latte (iced)!",
